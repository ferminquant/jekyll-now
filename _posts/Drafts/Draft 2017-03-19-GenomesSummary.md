# Chapter 1 The Human Genome

## Learning outcomes

Humans have two types of genomes:
- Nuclear genome: 3.2 billion nucleotides of DNA. 24 chromosomes (22 autsomes + 2 sex chromosomes), shortest in 50 million and longest 260 million.
- Mitochondrial genoms: 16569 nucleotides, and has multiple copies. 

Almost all cells have 2 copies of the 22 autosomes, plus the 2 sex cells. Except a few like red blood cells that have no nucleus. They are diploid, called somatic cells. 
Sex cells and gamets are haploid, only 23 chromosomes. 
Both cell types have 8000 copies of mitochondrial genome, 10 for each mitochondrion. 

## 1.1 DNA

DNA was discovered 3 years after Mendel's gene discovery, but were only linked until 1930s. 

### 1.1.1 Genes are made of DNA

Between 1900s and 1930s, chromosomes were made equally of DNA and proteins. Thought DNA was all the same, and proteins were the basis of life. 

#### Bacterial genes are made of DNA

First  to identify chemical composition were scientists looking for a cure to pneumonia. 

Found there were many types, some were harmless. Mice with harmful type died, and with harmless survived. Mice with dead cells of harmful type and alive harmless cells also died. This was called transformation - they exchanged genetic material with the dead harmful cells. Found it was DNA until 1944.

#### Virus genes are made of DNA

Some viruses, called phages, infected bateria to reproduce. Made of only DNA and protein, if only one of the two went into the bacteria, that should be the genetic material.

DNA has phosphorus and protein does not, they use radioactive phosphorus isotope. Protein has sulfur and DNA does not. New phages  had 50% of DNA and 1% protein of original phages.

These results were not conclusive, but it was an alert to study DNA more. 

### 1.1.2 The structure of DNA

Watson and Crick, they found the helix shape not the DNA structure. 

#### Nucleotides and polynucleotides

4 bases of DNA:
- A: Adenine
- C: Cytosine
- G: Guanine
- T: Thymine

Each nucleotides has 3 components:
- 2'-deoxyribose: a type of sugar
- A nitrogenous base: one of the A,C,G or T
- A phosphate group: 1,2 or 3 phosphate units, attached to the sugar.

#### RNA

RNA similar to DNA, two differences. Sugar is ribose, has uracil instead of thymine. So it is A, C, G, U. RNA is less stable, and are no more than a few thousand nucleotides, unlike DNA which are million sized.

### 1.1.3 The double helix

Watson and Crick, Saturday 7 March 1953, discovered the DNA was assembled as a double helix. Somehow the most important breakthrough in biology of the 20th century. 

#### The evidence that led to the double helix

Four types of information:
- Biophysical data: the water content of DNA allowed estimation of the density
- X-ray diffraction patterns: produced by Rosalind Franklin.
- The base ratios: ratios of A to T, and C to G are always the same in different organisms. 
- Model building: made models of possible DNA structures.

#### The key features of the double helix

The helix is right handed, it is rolled counter-clockwise. Is a spiral stairs, the outer handrail is to the right. 

DNA start and end are different. The helix, each strand runs in opposite directions. 

Helix is stabilized by two chemical interactions:
- Base pairings: A/C in one strand is hydrogen bonded to T/G on the other strand. <A,T> and <C,G>.
- Base stacking: gives more stability. 

The pairing rule somehow makes DNA replication exact. 

#### The double helix has structural flexibility

Helical diameter 2.37 nm, rise of 0.34 nm per base pair, pitch of 3.4 nm (distance taken up by a complete turn of the helix) for 10 base pairs per turn. This is called B-form, and most are like this, but not all (A and Z forms are examples).

DNA lenght is based on base pair. RNA is single stranded, so their length is expressed in  nucleotides.

## 1.2 The Human Genome

DNA sequence is the critical feature. 
The Human Genome Project, the largest world collaboration in science. Only ~84% of genome. Remaining 16% are the very ends of chromosomes (the telomeres) and centromeres (few if any genes are there).

Drafts, 2.6 billion base pairs of sequence. Equivalent to 3000 books this size, and 5000 km in length.

Differences in genomes of individuals are called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Example, I have A, someone else has G. 1.4 million SNPS identified, one per 2 kb of sequence. 

Every 2 kb has a series of repeated nucleotides (STR, microsatellites), the number of repeate is variable in each individual. Many do not affect the function but others do. Example, 60000 SNPs within genes and some impact the activities of the genes. 

### 1.2.1 The content of the human nuclear genome

50 kb segment in chromosome 7
part of human beta T cell receptor locus, 685 kb, involved in immune response.
It has the following genetic features:
- One gene: TRY4, protein trypsinogen, precursor to digestive enzyme trypsin. Nothing to do with immune response, they just share the space. TRY4 is a discontinous gene. 5 exons and 4 introns. 
- Two gene segments: V28 and V29-1
- One pseudogene: non functional copy of a gene. Its nucleotide sequence has changed, became unreadable, TRY5.
- 52 genome-wide repeat sequences: they recurs in many places in the genome. Four types LINEs, SINEs, LTR, DNA transposons. 
- Two microstatellites: GA 16 times, TATT 6 times
- 50% are stretches of non-genic, non-repetitive, single-copy DNA of no known function or significance. 

#### Genes and related sequences

Most genes specify one or more protein, the expression, through an intermediate messenger RNA, mRNA, from nucleus to cytoplasm, where protein is made. Other genes do not make proteins, non-coding RNA, they play various roles. 

Most human genes are discontinuous, average 9 exons per gene. Largest is titin, 178 exons 80780 bp. 

First RNA is a copy of the entire gene, splicing removes introns from the pre-mRNA to make mRNA. Splicing may make many combinations, for many proteins. Pre-mRNA has parts after and before the gene, unstranslated regions.

In T cells, genes can have different combinations, not splicing, gene rearrangement. Average gene is pretty much useless, most are different.

#### The functions of human genes

About 30-40000 genes. Most code proteins. < 2500 non-coding RNA. 1/4 of protein genes are for genome maintenance. 20% regulate genome expression and signals from outside the cell. Enzyme 17.5% and others. 13000 genes functions not yet known. 

#### Pseudogenes and other evolutionary relics

These shows the genome undergoes change. Two main types of pseudogene:
- A conventional pseudogene: inactive, nucleotide sequence changed by mutation. 
- A processed pseudogene: abnormal gene expression. Gene -> RNA -> DNA -> Pseudogene

Other relics: truncated genes, gene dragments.

#### Genome-wide repeats and microsatellites

62% genome are intergenic regions, between genes, no known functions. Used to be called junk DNA, but no longer used. They are made of repeated sequences. 

Repetitive DNA 2 categories, genome-wide or interspered repeats (around the genome) and tandemly repeated DNA (next to each other).

Genome-wide derive from transposable elements, can move around the genome, they leave copies when they move. 44% of genome sequences, some 1400Mb of DNA.

Microsatellites are randemly repeated DNA. Short, up to 13 bp, but others are long. Might be by-products of replication.

### 1.2.2 The human mitochondrial genome

The complete sequence has been known for 20 years. Just 16569 bp, 37 genes. 13 code proteins for respiratory complex. 24 non-coding RNA molecules, for its own expression. Genes are closer to each other, no introns, typical in other animals. 

No wasted space, ATP6 and ATP8 overlap.

## 1.3 Why is the Human Genome Project Important?

To understand genetic diseases. 
Transcriptome and proteome - how the genome is used by the cell. Unknown future benefits. Stretches current technology limits.
