title: Reinforcement Learning
---

For now I am using this blog post as a way to save links to resources I have found useful while learning about reinforcement learning.

* [A for starters series of videos. The first time I started to understand how RL worked.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWi7UcbOD_0u1eUjmF59XW2TGHWdkHjnS)
* [A complete course on RL. Seems good but most it too theoretical for my taste.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-jPKtc4r78-wCZcQn5IqyuWhBZ8fOxT)
* [RL assignments of a class on AI, you can download and play with the code.](http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
