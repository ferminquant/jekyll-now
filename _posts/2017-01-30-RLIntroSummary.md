title: Book Summary - Reinforcement Learning An Introduction
---

My summary of the book "Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto" found [here](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html). 

I write this as my notes as I go through the book from cover to cover. The purpose is to have them as personal reference notes, not to re-explain what is already in the book. However, they might be useful for someone else.

I found part I and II better explained and more useful. Part III seems to be more about what things can be advanced through more research, and it felt like the authors didn't have such a great grasp of the concepts explained like in Part I and II, or at least they didn't bother explaining with the same level of quality. I think like this because one of my favorite quotes is from Albert Einstein which states "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough". Parts I and II were explained simply, part III not so much.
