title: Playing with Many Classification Algorithms on the Titanic Data Set
---

In this post I make a comparison of different classification algorithms, using the training data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The data is small, and you can't get more, so the full difference between algorithms probably won't be noticed. I put up the whole code on my [Github]().

The first algorithm used will be a simple linear model, for which I used the lm function from R, code [here]().

```r 
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))
x <- 1:10
```
