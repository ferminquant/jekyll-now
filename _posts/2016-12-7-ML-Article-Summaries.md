title: Machine Learning Article Summaries
---

For some time now I have been finding, reading and studying a lot of articles and videos about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general. I found myself learning a lot from them, and connecting dots everywhere. After some time when trying to remember where I learned about a specific topic I found I didn't remember the deepest details, so I had to go through the ardous task of looking through all my bookmarks or even finding it again by googling it, and even after finding it most of the time I had to go through the whole article to remember the exact mindset I had at the time to find what I was looking for in the first place.

Because of this, I thought it a good idea to have a place to organize the links and what I learned from each, to be able to easily find reference material in the future. However, I found it to be a little overkill to write a summary blog post for each article I find, hence I am making one blog post for every article with a short summary of each. If it eventually grows too much I might need to branch it out, or not and just organize a super long post. So without further ado, here are my summaries:

#Introductions
####[What is holding you back from your machine learning goals?](http://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-holding-you-back-from-your-machine-learning-goals/)

It is a short motivational post with the goal to get you immediately started with Machine Learning. It tells you why you should start even if you don't feel ready, and urges you to start with small projects, with links on how to do so. 

I find it a nice post for starters, since when I began my quest in machine learning I took lot of courses and read lots of resources, but found myself not using or even needed more than half of it when I finally started working on real problems.

##Deep Learning
###Convolutional Neural Networks
####[A Beginner's Guide To Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/)

This is the first post of a series of three that introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in order to get a deeper intuition into how they work. I had learned CNNs existed and that they were used for computer vision and automatic feature extraction, but until I found this post I hadn't grasped how exactly did it do that, and how and why was it different from normal neural networks or why did they need to be deep?

It doesn't touch everything, but the post is still great. I gives a clear example of how it find patterns in the first layers and how the connections are different from the first neural networks. It explains fairly well the convolutional layers, but leaves for later the ReLU and Pool layers. Here I found a link to a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgkfIQ4IGaM) which really gives you a greater vision of what convolution does and why it works great for computer vision.

I goes a little into the final fully connected layer, backpropagation, testing and touches a little of its nuances. It is not so superficial, but not as comprehensive as the convolution part (which is what the post is supposed to be about), and I think I understood what he wrote in those parts because I already knew about them.

A very good post overall, and fulfills its goal of introducing CNNs to a technical audience who wishes to understand how they work.

####[Video: Deep Visualization Toolbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgkfIQ4IGaM)

This is the video mentioned above. It is the best video I have found that literally shows in real-time how the neurons in a CNN activate with certain features, and how the deeper the layer, the broader part of the image that each neuron recognizes.

The first time I saw it was eye-opening, but after working more on convolution layers, I watched it again and found it to be more impressive than what I thought at first. Really recommended video to watch.
