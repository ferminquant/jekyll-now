My formal education includes a bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering and an MBA in Information Technology Management. Through work experience I learned about Data Warehouse and Data Modeling. In the last years I self-taught myself Machine Learning and used the knowledge in work projects. Most recently I am deepening my knowledge and experience of Artificial Intelligence (Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning to be more specific).
